- How do I merge a branch changes?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you are collaborating, you will have to merge a branch independent if your branch may or may not have diverged from the main branch. Most of the Git hosting platform like GiHub or Gitlab allows you to merge a branch from their web interface but you can also merge the branches from your machine using `git merge`.

There are 2 ways to merge:

- non-fast-forward merged (recommended)

- fast forward merged

![Merging diagram.](fig/09-merging.png){alt="A diagram showing different types of Git merges."}


## Fast-forward Merge

If there are no conflicts with the main branch, we can perform a "fast-forward" merge. This works
by moving the branch pointer to the latest commit in the target branch. This is the default behaviour
of `git merge` (when possible).

Let's merge in our `yaml-format` branch back into `main` using a fast-forward merge:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge yaml-format
```

```output
$ git merge yaml-format
Updating ec240ab..68b09d0
Fast-forward
 guacamole.md   | 7 -------
 guacamole.yaml | 6 ++++++
 2 files changed, 6 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 guacamole.md
 create mode 100644 guacamole.yaml
```

If we look at the log, we can see that the commits that we made on the `yaml-format` branch are now
a part of the `main` branch:

```output
$ git log --oneline --graph
68b09d0 (HEAD -> main, yaml-format) Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension.
a2b55be Reformat recipe to use YAML.
ec240ab Ignore png files and the pictures folder.
20c856c Write prices for ingredients and their source
11cdb65 Add some initial cakes
7cdeaef Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
4b58094 Add ingredients for basic guacamole
cdb0c21 Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```

::: callout

Note that our old branch is stil there!

```output
$ git branch -avv
* main        68b09d0 Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension.
  yaml-format 68b09d0 Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension.
```

It's just that both branches now point to the same commit. Until we specifically delete the branch,
it will remain in the repository.

:::

If using the fast-forward merge, it is impossible to see from the `git` history which of the commit objects together have implemented a feature. You would have to manually read all the log messages. Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), is a true headache in the latter situation, whereas it is easily done if the --no-ff flag was used.

For a good illustration of fast-forward merge (and other concepts), see this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069061/what-effect-does-the-no-ff-flag-have-for-git-merge

## Non-fast-forwad Merge

A non fast-forward merge makes a new commit that ties together the histories of both branches.

Let's make a new branch and add a commit to it:

```bash
git branch add-instructions
git switch add-instructions
nano guacamole.yaml
```

```yaml
instructions: |
  1. Cut avocados in half and remove pit.
  2. Make guacamole.
```

```bash
git add guacamole.yaml
git commit -m "Add instructions to guacamole recipe."
```

Now, let's move back to the main branch and merge the changes from the `add-instructions` branch
using a non-fast-forward merge:

```bash
git switch main
git merge --no-ff add-instructions -m "Merge add-instructions branch into main."
```

```output
$ git merge --no-ff add-instructions -m "Merge add-instructions branch into main."
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
 guacamole.yaml | 4 +++-
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Let's look at the log to see what happened:

```output
$ git log --oneline --graph
$ git log --oneline --graph
*   a20b39f (HEAD -> main) Merge add-instructions branch into main.
|\
| * 22e4eb6 (add-instructions) Add instructions to guacamole recipe.
|/
* 68b09d0 (yaml-format) Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension.
* a2b55be Reformat recipe to use YAML.
```

The `--no-ff` flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could
be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of
a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

## Merge Conflicts

When merging branches, it's not uncommon to encounter a "merge conflict". This happens when the
same part of the same has been modified in both the source and target branches. In these cases,
git will pause the merge and ask you to resolve the conflict manually.

Let's create a conflict by modifying the same line in both branches.

```bash
git switch main
git branch modify-guac-instructions
git switch modify-guac-instructions
nano guacamole.yaml
```

And let's change the final step to something more informative:

```yaml
instructions: |
  1. Cut avocados in half and remove pit.
  2. Slice the avocados and mash them with a fork.
```

Commit the change:

```bash
git add guacamole.yaml
git commit -m "Modify guacamole instructions to include mashing."
```

Now, let's switch back to the `main` branch and modify the same line differently:

```bash
git switch main
nano guacamole.yaml
```

Change the final step to:

```yaml
instructions: |
  1. Cut avocados in half and remove pit.
  2. Use a food processor to blend the avocados.
```

Commit the change:

```bash
git add guacamole.yaml
git commit -m "Modify guacamole instructions to include food processor."
```

Now, let's try to merge the `modify-guac-instructions` branch into `main`:

```bash
git merge modify-guac-instructions
```

```output
$ git merge modify-guac-instructions
Auto-merging guacamole.yaml
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in guacamole.yaml
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

In addition to this message, our branch name in the terminal prompt may also be prefixed with
`(main|MERGING)` to indicate that we are in the middle of a merge, and not in the normal flow of
git operations.

Git has marked the conflict in the `guacamole.yaml` file. Let's open it to see what happened:

```
nano guacamole.yaml
```

```yaml
name: Guacamole
ingredients:
  avocado: 1.35
  lime: 0.64
  salt: 2
instructions: |
  1. Cut avocados in half and remove pit.
<<<<<< HEAD
  2. Use a food processor to blend the avocados.
=======
  2. Slice the avocados and mash them with a fork.
>>>>>> modify-guac-instructions
```

The lines between `<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` show the changes from the `main` branch, while the
lines between `=======` and `>>>>>> modify-guac-instructions` show the changes from
the `modify-guac-instructions` branch.

There are tools and editors that can help you resolve merge conflicts, but at its core, all we need
to do is decide which changes to keep. We can keep one side, the other side, or even combine
both changes.

You can resolve the conflict however you like - as long as the final file is valid and no longer
contains the merge conflict markers.

Upon saving the file, however, the merge is not yet complete. We need to stage the resolved file and
commit the merge:

```bash
git add guacamole.yaml
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in guacamole.yaml."
```

We can see the branch / merge process in our log:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph
```

```output
$ git log --oneline --graph
*   a94e041 (HEAD -> main) Resolve merge conflict in guacamole.yaml.
|\
| * 21be5b1 (modify-guac-instructions) Modify guacamole instructions mashing.
* | c6ae196 Modify guacamole instructions to include food processor.
|/
*   d6ade9c Merge add-instructions branch into main.
|\
| * 4d1c414 (add-instructions) Add instructions to guacamole recipe.
|/
* f36de20 (yaml-format) Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension.
...
```

## Exercise: Creating a fast-forward merge.

Create a branch in your repository for finishing the guacamole recipe by adding instructions.
Then, merge the branch back into `main` using a fast-forward merge.

:::::::::::::::  solution

```bash
git branch finish-guac-recipe
git switch finish-guac-recipe
nano guacamole.yaml
```

```yaml
instructions: |
  1. Cut avocados in half and remove pit.
  2. Mash avocados with a fork.
  3. Add lime juice and salt to taste.
```

```bash
git add guacamole.yaml
git commit -m "Add instructions to guacamole recipe."
git switch main
git merge finish-guac-recipe
```

## Exercise: Resolving a merge conflict.

Create a merge conflict by modifying the same line in both the `main` branch and a new branch.
Then, merge the new branch into `main`, resolve the conflict, and complete the merge.

This is free-form, so there is no single correct solution.

:::::::::::::::  solution


```bash
git switch main
nano salsa.md
git add salsa.md
git commit -m "Add initial salsa recipe."
git branch modify-salsa
git switch modify-salsa
nano salsa.md
git add salsa.md
git commit -m "Modify salsa recipe to include tomatoes."
git switch main
nano salsa.md
git add salsa.md
git commit -m "Modify salsa recipe to include onions."
git merge modify-salsa
# Resolve the conflict in salsa.md
git add salsa.md
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in salsa.md."
```

### Three-way Merge

Similar to `--no-ff`, but there may be dragons. Forced upon you when there's an intermediate change since you branched.
May prompt your to manually resolve

```bash
git merge <branch> [-s <strategy>]
```

See https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies for a zillion options (“patience”, “octopus”, etc),  But also git is only so smart and you are probably smarter.

There are a number of external tools that have a graphical interface to allow for merge conflict resolution. Some of these include: [kdiff3](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net) (Windows, Mac, Linux), [Meld](https://meldmerge.org) (Windows, Linux), [P4Merge](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core-apps/merge-diff-tool-p4merge) (Windows, Mac, Linux),  [opendiff](https://github.com/andrewchaa/opendiff) (Mac), [vimdiff](https://devhints.io/vim-diff) (for Vim users), [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php?zz=dl3_en), GitHub web interface. **We do not endorse any of them and use at your own risk.** In any case, using a graphical interface does not substitute for understanding what is happening under the hood.
:::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `git merge --no-ff` is the best way to merge changes
- `git merge --ff-only` is a good way to pull down changes from remote
- merge conflicts happen when the same part of the same file has been modified in both branches
- merge conflicts must be resolved manually
