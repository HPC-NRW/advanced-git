:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use an interactive rebase to clean up merge requests before the merge.
- Rebased branches need to be force-pushed due to history changes.
- Squashing can be used to combine multiple commits
- Depending on the project policy merge requests may need to be cleaned up
  before they are allowed upstream.
