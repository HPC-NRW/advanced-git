# What is a cherry-pick?

If there is a specific change present in a different branch that you need in another branch, Git
lets you "cherry-pick" those commits. The "cherry-pick" command is a way of copying a specific commit
from one branch to another. Each commit in git has a specific identifier (the "hash" or "SHA" of
the commit) that we can use to refer to that exact commit. You can see the hash of your recent
commits by running:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Note that this only shows the commits that are present on this "branch". If you want to see commits
from all branches, you can run:

```bash
git log --oneline --all
```

or checkout the specific branch you want to see.

So why would I want to cherry-pick a commit?

- Imagine you have a branch where you are working on a new feature. You make several commits to
  this branch, but as you work you realize that one of the commits you just made would be
  important to include in the "main" branch right away.
- Or maybe you're working on a branch and realize that the commit you just made would be better
  suited to a different branch.
- Or maybe you have a branch with several commits, but you realize that you want to split these out
  into one or more branches.

::: callout
The more confined and specific commits are, the better they can be cherry-picked.

In these cases, you can use "cherry-pick" to move a specific commit from one branch to another.

## How to cherry-pick

The `cherry-pick` command looks like this:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

::: callout

Note that we don't have to provide any information about the source branch, because the commit
hashes are unique across the entire repository. Git will find the commit with the specified hash,
then apply it to the current branch.

:::

Let's modify our `groceries.md` file in our `bean-dip` branch:

```bash
nano groceries.md
```

```markdown
# Market A
* avocado: 1.35 per unit.
* lime: 0.64 per unit
* salt: 2 per kg
* black beans: 0.99 per can
```

```bash
git add groceries.md
git commit -m "Add bean dip ingredients to groceries"
```

Wait though! We actually want this change to happen in the `main` branch instead. We can
switch to the `main` branch and cherry-pick the commit we just made in the `bean-dip` branch:

Use `git log --oneline` in the `bean-dip` branch to find the commit hash of the commit we just made:

```output
$ git log --oneline
4a473c9 (HEAD -> bean-dip) Add bean dip ingredients to groceries
b8732e4 Add bean dip recipe
79cb366 (origin/bean-dip) Add bean dip recipe.
```

(Your commit hash will be different.)

Now switch to the `main` branch and cherry-pick that commit:

```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

```output
$ git cherry-pick 4a473c9
[main 68fbfdc] Add bean dip ingredients to groceries
 Date: Thu Nov 27 23:11:28 2025 +0100
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

The command will then apply the changes only from the specified commit to the current branch,
creating a new commit with those changes.

## Undoing a cherry-pick

If you cherry-pick a commit and then realize that you made a mistake, you can undo the cherry-pick
using the `git reset` command we showed earlier:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Issues with cherry-pick

cherry-picking is an infrequent operation, and it can lead to some issues if not used carefully.
Some things to keep in mind:

- You are creating a new commit on the branch, which means that if the original commit is later
  merged into the branch, you may end up with a merge conflict.
- If the commit you are cherry-picking depends on other commits that are not present in the target
  branch, you may run into issues when trying to apply the changes or run the code.
- The new commit will look identical to the old commit, but with a different hash. This can make
  it difficult to visually track changes across branches.

## Cherry-picking Exercise

Create a new branch called `cookies` and add a recipe for chocolate chip cookies to
a new file `cookies/chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. Commit this file. Then add one of the ingredients
for your cookies to the `groceries.md` file in the same branch. Finally, add the instructions
for the cookies in another commit.

How can you get just the change to groceries.md into the `main` branch?


:::: solution
1. Create and switch to the `cookies` branch:

```bash
git branch cookies
git switch cookies
```
2. Create the recipe file and add the recipe:

```bash
nano cookies/chocolate-chip-cookies.md
```

3. Make your changes to `chocolate-chip-cookies.md` and `groceries.md`, committing each change.

4. Use `git log --oneline` to find the commit hash for the change to `groceries.md`.
5. Switch to the `main` branch and cherry-pick the commit:

```bash
git switch main
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

## Cherry Pick a Range of Commits

Switch to your cookies branch again. Now let's create the following file:

```markdown
# Sugar Cookies
## Ingredients
- sugar: 200g
- flour: 300g
- butter: 150g
## Instructions
```

Then in ``groceries.md``, add the sugar to the end of the file and commit this change.

In another commit, add flour and butter to `groceries.md` and commit this change.

Finally, add the instructions for sugar cookies to the sugar cookie file and commit this change.

Checkout the `main` branch again. How can you cherry-pick both of the commits that modified
`groceries.md` into the `main` branch?

What is different about cherry-picking a range of commits compared to a single commit?

::: hint
Run `git cherry-pick --help` and look at some of the examples.
:::

:::: solution

Thy syntax for cherry-picking a range of commits is:

```bash
git cherry-pick <oldest-commit-hash>..<newest-commit-hash>
```

So if the two commits that modified `groceries.md` have the hashes `a1b2c3d` and `d4e5f6g`, you
would run:

```bash
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d..d4e5f6g
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- You can cherry-pick specific commits from one branch to another using `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`.
