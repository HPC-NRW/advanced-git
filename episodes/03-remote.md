Git's distributed collaboration model, which gives every developer their own copy of the repository, complete with its own local history and branch structure. Users typically need to share a series of commits rather than a single "changeset". Instead of committing a "changeset" from a working copy to the central repository, Git lets you share entire branches between repositories.

## Git remote

The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

![Remote Schematic](fig/06-remote.png){alt="A diagram showing a local git repository with remote connections to two other repositories."}

For example, the diagram above shows two remote connections from your repo into the central repo and another developer’s repo. Instead of referencing them by their full URLs, you can pass the origin and john shortcuts to other Git commands.

The `git remote` command is essentially an interface for managing a list of remote entries that are stored in the repository's `./.git/config` file. The following commands are used to view the current state of the remote list.

Git is designed to give each developer an entirely isolated development environment. This means that information is not automatically passed back and forth between repositories. Instead, developers need to manually pull upstream commits into their local repository or manually push their local commits back up to the central repository. The `git remote` command is really just an easier way to pass URLs to these "sharing" commands.

## Adding a Remote Repository

Earlier, we created a repository on GitLab. Now, we need to connect our local repository to that remote repository. The command for this is `git remote add`:

```bash
git remote add origin <REPOSITORY-URL>
```

::: callout

You can find the repository URL on the main page of your remote repository. It should look something like `https://gitlab.com/username/repository-name.git`.

Most hosting services will provide the URL in two forms: HTTPS and SSH. If you are unsure which one to use, choose HTTPS. SSH requires additional setup which we do not cover in this training.

:::

## View Remote Configuration

To list the remote connections of your repository to other repositories you can use the `git remote` command:

```bash
git remote
```

If you test this in our training repository, you should get only one connection, `origin`:
```bash
origin
```

::: callout

When you clone a repository with `git clone`, `git` automatically creates a remote connection called `origin` pointing back to the cloned repository. This is useful for developers creating a local copy of a central repository, since it provides an easy way to pull upstream changes or publish local commits. This behaviour is also why most Git-based projects call their central repository origin.

We can ask `git` for a more verbose (`-v`) answer which gives us the URLs for the connections:

```bash
git remote -v
```

:::

## Syncing with Remote Repositories

So we have a remote connection, but how do we make the code in our local repository match the code in the remote repository? There are three commands that we use to sync code between repositories: `git fetch`, `git pull`, and `git push`.

- `fetch` - Downloads commits, files, and refs, but does not modify your working directory. This gives you a chance to review changes before integrating them into your local repository.
- `pull` - Downloads commits, files, and refs, and immediately merges them into your local branch. This is a convenient way to integrate changes from a remote repository into your local repository in one step.
- `push` - Uploads your local commits to a remote repository. This is how you share your changes with other developers.

Let's use `git pull` to retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull
```

```output
$ git pull
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 2.74 KiB | 701.00 KiB/s, done.
From <REPOSITORY-URL>
 * [new branch]      main       -> origin/main
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> main
```

So what happened? As we might have seen in previous sections, git isn't always clever, or at least it isn't willing to make assumptions about what we want to do. In this case, git is saying that it pulled down changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't know what to do with them. This is because our local `main` branch isn't set up to track the `main` branch on the `origin` remote.

We can use the suggested command to set up the tracking information:

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```

This explicitly tells git that the local `main` branch is the same as the `main` branch on the `origin` remote. Now, if we run `git pull` again, git will know what to do:

```bash
git pull
```

```output
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

Why? When we created our remote repository, we initialized it with a README file. This created an initial commit in the remote repository that doesn't exist in our local repository. Git sees that the commits in our local repository and the single commit in the remote don't seem to be from the same tree, and so it refuses to merge them. To fix this, we can use the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag to tell
git to go ahead and merge the two histories:

```bash
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
```

You should be asked to provide a merge commit message. Save and close the editor to complete the merge.

```output
$ git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
 README.md | 93 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 1 file changed, 93 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

So that pulled a README.md file from the remote repository and merged it into our local repository. If we look at the log, we can see that we now have two commits: our original commit and a merge commit that brings in the changes from the remote repository.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

```output
$ git log --oneline
0622c3a (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'main' of https://gitlab.git.nrw/hartman/git-workshop
5be9f46 (origin/main) Initial commit
68b09d0 (yaml-format) Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension.
a2b55be Reformat recipe to use YAML.
```

::: callout

Note here that the log command also tells us about the locations of the pointers for each branch. We can see that our local `main` branch (HEAD -> main) is now at the merge commit, and the `origin/main` branch is at the initial commit from the remote repository. We can also see that our `yaml-format` branch is still at the commit where we renamed the recipe file.

:::

## Viewing Remote Information

To see more detailed information about a specific remote connection, you can use the `git remote show` command followed by the name of the remote. For example, to see information about the `origin` remote, you would run:

```bash
git remote show origin
```

```output
$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: <REPOSITORY-URL>
  Push  URL: <REPOSITORY-URL>
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branch:
    main tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (fast-forwardable)
```

::: callout

It's possible to have more than one remote for a given repository. You can add additional remotes with `git remote add <name> <url>`, and then view them with `git remote -v` or `git remote show <name>`.

This might be used if, for instance, you have a central repository that you store your projects in, but also another repository that you use for backup purposes. You could have remotes called `origin` and `backup`, each pointing to different URLs.

:::

## Pushing to Remote Repositories

We pulled changes from the remote repository, but if we refresh the page on GitLab, we won't see our local commits there. If we run the `git status` command we can see that git is aware that our local branch has some commits that aren't on the remote branch:

```output
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 9 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Let's use the `git push` command to upload our local commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

```output
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 28, done.
Counting objects: 100% (28/28), done.
Delta compression using up to 2 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
Writing objects: 100% (27/27), 2.72 KiB | 696.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 27 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To <REPOSITORY-URL>
   5be9f46..0622c3a  main -> main
```

If we now refresh the page on GitLab, we should see our commits there!

## Create and Modify Connections

The `git remote` command also lets you manage connections with other repositories. The following commands will modify the repo's `./.git/config` file. The result of the following commands can also be achieved by directly editing the `./.git/config` file with a text editor.

Create a new connection to a remote repository. After adding a remote, you'll be able to use `＜name＞` as a convenient shortcut for `＜url＞` in other Git commands.

```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
```


Remove the connection:

```bash
git remote rm <name>
```

Rename a connection:
```bash
git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

To get high-level information about the remote `＜name＞`:
```bash
git show <name>
```

Exercise: Add a connection to your neighbour's repository. Having this kind of access to individual developers' repositories makes it possible to collaborate outside of the central repository. This can be very useful for small teams working on a large project.

```bash
git remote add john http://dev.example.com/john.git
```


## Starting a branch from the main repository state:

Remember that when you create a new branch without specifying a starting point, then the starting point will be the current state and branch. In order to avoid confusion, ALWAYS branch from the stable version. Here is how you would branch from your own origin/main branch:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git checkout -b <branch> origin/main
```

You must fetch first so that you have the most recent state of the repository.

If there is another "true" version/state of the project, then this connection may be set as upstream (or something else). `Upstream` is a common name for the stable repository, then the sequence will be:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git checkout -b <branch> upstream/main
```

Now we can set the MPIA version of our repository as the upstream for our local copy.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Setting the upstream repository

Set the https://github.com/mpi-astronomy/advanced-git-training as the upstream locally.

Then, examine the state of your repository with `git branch`, `git remote -v`, `git remote show upstream`

:::::::::::::::  solution

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mpi-astronomy/advanced-git-training.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b develop upstream/develop
```

## Creating a branch and pushing it to the remote

Create a new branch in our local repository called `bean-dip` and add the following recipe in a file called `bean-dip.md`:

```
# Bean Dip
## Ingredients
- beans
## Instructions
```

Add and commit the new file, then push the new branch to the remote repository with `git push`. What happens? Can you find the branch on the remote?

:::::::::::::::  solution

```bash
git branch bean-dip
git switch bean-dip
nano bean-dip.md
git add bean-dip.md
git commit -m "Add bean dip recipe."
git push
```

What happens here can depend on the version of git you are using. In more recent versions, git will automatically create the remote branch when you push a local branch that doesn't exist on the remote. In older versions, you may need to specify the remote and branch name explicitly:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin bean-dip
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The `git remote` command allows us to create, view and delete connections to other repositories.
- Remote connections are like bookmarks to other repositories.
- Other git commands (`git fetch`, `git push`, `git pull`) use these bookmarks to carry out their syncing responsibilities.
