Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other version control systems can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. In `git`, branches are a part of your everyday development process. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.

The diagram above visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, it’s not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main branch free from questionable code.

The implementation behind Git branches is much more lightweight than other version control system models. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commits—it's not a container for commits. The history for a branch is extrapolated through the commit relationships.

## What is a branch?

In `git` a branch is effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. It's important to understand that branches are just pointers to commits. When you create a branch, all Git needs to do is create a new pointer, it doesn't change the repository in any other way. If you start with a repository that looks like this:

![Git Branching: A branch is just a "named pointer" to a commit.  (Source: [Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches))](fig/04-branching.png){alt="A diagram showing several commits on a single branch in a theoretical git repository."}

Let's say we wanted to reworking our recipes to use a different format. We could continue on our
existing branch, but we're not so sure about this change, so instead we create a new branch to
experiment with:

```bash
git branch yaml-format
```

The repository history remains unchanged. All you get is a new pointer to the current commit:

![Git Branching: The new branch is pointing to the same commit from which it was branched off. (Source: [Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches))](fig/05-branching.png){alt="A diagram showing a new branch pointer in a theoretical git repository."}


Note that this only creates the new branch. To start adding commits to it, you need to move to it with `git checkout`, and then use the standard `git add` and `git commit` commands.

A branch *also* means an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project. However, it is really important to remember that each commit only records the incremental change in the document and NOT the full history of changes. Therefore, while we think of a branch as a sequence of commits, each commit is independent unit of change.

## Branching Commands

Creating, deleting, and modifying branches is quick and easy; here’s a summary of the commands:

To list all branches:
```bash
git branch
```

```output
$ git branch
* main
  yaml-format
```

The asterisk (`*`) indicates the current branch. To see more information about each branch,
including the latest commit on each branch, use the `-avv` flags:

```bash
git branch -avv
```
```output
$ git branch -avv
* main        ec240ab Ignore png files and the pictures folder.
  yaml-format ec240ab Ignore png files and the pictures folder.
```

We can see that, as we have not added any new commits to the `yaml-format` branch, both branches
point to the same commit (`ec240ab`).

::: spoiler

To create a new branch named `<branch>`, which *references the same point in history as the current branch.*
```bash
git branch <branch>
```

To create a new branch named `<branch>`, referencing `<start-point>`, which may be specified any way you like, including using a branch name or a tag name:

```bash
git branch <branch> <start-point>
```

To delete the branch `<branch>`; if the branch is not fully merged in its upstream branch or contained in the current branch, this command will fail with a warning:
```bash
git branch -d <branch>
```

To delete the branch `<branch>` irrespective of its merged status:
```bash
git branch -D <branch>
```

Renaming a branch can be done with the `-m` tag:
```bash
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>
```

:::

Let's switch over to our new branch so we can start making changes:

```bash
git switch yaml-format
```

```output
$ git switch yaml-format
Switched to branch 'yaml-format'
```

::: callout

`git switch` was introduced in Git 2.23 as a more purpose specific command for switching branches.
It is functionally similar to `git checkout`, which is still used widely, but is a more general
command with multiple purposes (switching branches, restoring files, etc).

To create a new branch `<new>` referencing `<start-point>`, and check it out.

```bash
git switch -c <new> <start-point>
```

:::

The special symbol `"HEAD"` can always be used to refer to the current branch. In fact, Git uses a file named `HEAD` in the `.git` directory to remember which branch is current:

```bash
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
```

Let's reformat our recipe to use YAML and commit the changes:

```bash
nano guacamole.md
```

```
name: Guacamole
ingredients:
  avocado: 1.35
  lime: 0.64
  salt: 2
instructions: ""
```

```bash
git add guacamole.md
git commit -m "Reformat recipe to use YAML."
```

Now let's check our branches again:

```bash
git branch -avv
```

```output
$ git branch -avv
  main        ec240ab Ignore png files and the pictures folder.
* yaml-format a2b55be Reformat recipe to use YAML.
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

Challenge 1: Renaming a file in a branch

We updated our guacamole recipe in the `yaml-format` branch to use a different format. But now the
file extension `.md` doesn't make sense anymore. Rename the file to `guacamole.yaml` and commit the
change to the `yaml-format` branch. Run `git status` before you commit your changes. Is there
anything different about the way this commit looks than in our earlier exercises?

::: hint

You can use the `mv` command to rename files in the terminal:

```bash
mv old-filename new-filename
```

:::

:::::::::::::::  solution

```bash
mv guacamole.md guacamole.yaml
git add guacamole.yaml guacamole.md
git status
```

```output
$ git status
On branch yaml-format
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        renamed:    guacamole.md -> guacamole.yaml
```

Git is not very clever about most things, but as long as the contents of the file are identical, it
can at least figure out that we just renamed the file, rather than deleting one and adding another.

```bash
git commit -m "Rename recipe file to use .yaml extension."
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A branch represents an independent line of development.
- `git branch` creates a new pointer to the current state of the repository and allows you to make subsequent changes from that state.
- Subsequent changes are considered to belong to that branch.
- The final commit on a given branch is its HEAD.
